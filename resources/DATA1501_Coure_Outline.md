## DATA 1501: Introduction to Data Science
### Course Description
This course is intended to provide an introduction into the field of Data Science. Students will develop skills in appropriate technology and basic statistical methods by completing hands-on projects focused on real-world data and addresses the social consequences of data analysis and application.

### Course Learning Outcomes
*Required Outcomes for all Sections of the Course*
(should account for 70 – 80% of course content)
* Explain the importance of and be able to formulate a data analysis problem statement that is clear, concise, and measurable.
* Identify and appropriately acknowledge sources of data.
* Be able to apply basic data cleaning techniques to prepare data for analysis.
* Be able to identify the categorical and/or numerical data types in a given data set.
* Apply appropriate descriptive and inferential methods to summarize data and identify associations and relationships. 
* Use appropriate tools and technology to collect, process, transform, summarize, and visualize data.
* Be able to draw accurate and useful conclusions from a data analysis. 
* Effectively communicate methods and findings in a variety of modes.
* Differentiate between ethical and unethical uses of data science.
*Additional Optional Learning Outcomes*
(should account for 20 – 30% of course content)

* Identify goals and methods of testing hypotheses.
* Explain the bootstrap methods.
* Identify legal issues surrounding the use of data.
* Mine data to develop predictive models and evaluation.
### Course Content
Provide a topical outline demonstrating the breadth and depth of the course. Please be as comprehensive as possible within the limits of an outline.
