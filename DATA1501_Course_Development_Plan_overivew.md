# DATA 1501 – Introduction to Data Science
## Course Development Plan

## Overview
The course development process for DATA 1501 will adapt a backwards design approach and collaborative project processes to build a shared resource. The result of this process will be a model course for Introduction to Data Science, including course outline, schedule, learning strategies, assessments, assignments, and resources. This model course is not required for adopting DATA 1501 for your institution but will hopefully provide a foundation for creating a course that supports students’ learning and engaging practice. 

Course development will take place in stages, with reflection (and some homework) in advance of virtual collaborations. The planning process is modeled on Dee Fink’s Significant Learning approach to course design and will use his brief workbook to course design to guide the work. You may be familiar with other approaches to course design, and are welcome to approach this course from the perspective and approach that is best suited to your style and context. 

In adopting this process, we ask that you do some of the development work on your own, and then share, review, and discuss the work with your partners in this process. 

**Stage 1** of this process will reflect on the situational factors for the course, review the established learning goals, consider the feedback and assessment procedures we can use to know that students have met the learning objective. 

**Stage 2** will identify teaching and learning activities that support the learning goals and provide an opportunity to consolidate the collective course elements to assess their alignment and determine the final consensus components. 

**Stage 3** will put the course together – the sequencing of the course into units, the identification and timing of in-class and out-of-class activities for the course, and the day-to-day or week-by-week course calendar. At the end of Stage 3, we hope to emerge with a well-designed course that can be adapted or adopted to a wide range of institutions. 

Sounds like a lot? This process may feel like a big task for a course that isn’t even in the catalog, much less in anyone’s degree map, but we hope it will result in a course that is both highly flexible and extremely well designed. We also hope that by creating a community around designing this course, we will be able to share some great ideas about instructional design and data science across the system.
