# Overview of activities for Stage 1 (December 12-January 13)
1.  Situational Factors
	1.	Review “A Self-Directed Guide to Designing Courses for Significant Learning,” by Dee Fink: https://www.deefinkandassociates.com/GuidetoCourseDesignAug05.pdf 
	2.	Reflect on situational factors 
		- Some are established: this is a lower division course without prerequisites other than exemption from Learning Support; open to students from any program of study
		- Others are variable: modality; class size; life situation of the learners; background of the instructor

2.  Learning Outcomes
Consider the Learning Outcomes established for the DATA 1501 course (available here). These outcomes were established by the Data Science Working Group and serve as the foundation for the commonly numbered course. Using Fink’s taxonomy of significant learning, assign each learning outcome to the area(s) it is most aligned with. If you find that there are areas not represented, you are invited to craft a learning outcome for that area.

3.  Feedback and Assessment Procedures
A key step in any backwards design approach to course development is the identification of feedback and assessment procedures to check on student learning and mastery and provide them feedback. Because DATA 1501 has a focus on real world data and applications, these procedures naturally lend themselves to authentic assessment of student knowledge and skill through the use of real-life examples and questions. 

Looking at the Learning Outcomes from step 2, and considering the widest range of approaches to how to evaluate student satisfaction of the outcomes, identify at least two forward-looking assessments for the course. You may want to review the USG Office of Faculty Development [webinars on Summative and Formative Assessment](https://www.usg.edu/facultydevelopment/centers/program_spotlight/fall_webinar_series) (halfway down the page) and [this handy toolbox on authentic assessments](http://jfmueller.faculty.noctrl.edu/toolbox/index.htm) from Jon Mueller at North Central College. Keep in mind that not all assessment tasks need to be large or complex to be of value, and having a variety of assessments can help you provide timely meaningful feedback.

With these assessment procedures in mind, consider how they measure one of the main learning goals and establish two criteria to demonstrate high quality achievement on that goal and the standards to distinguish levels of accomplishment.  This is essentially creating a part of an overall rubric for the assessment. For the purposes of this exercise, we will look at four levels of achievement, (essentially: needs work, satisfactory, good, and excellent, although these would vary depending on the criteria being assessed) and you may wish to have fewer or more levels. 

Simultaneously, providing a structured process for students to reflect on their performance helps to develop important skills. These self-assessments can be collective or individual, and may be highly informal, but should point back to the outcomes and expectations for the assessment and invite students to reflect on what they did well, where they could improve, and what they may need to do to achieve mastery.
