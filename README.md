# DATA1501
Introduction to Data Science Course Design
##DATA 1501 – Introduction to Data Science
###Course Development Plan

The course development process for DATA 1501 will adapt a backwards design approach and collaborative project processes to build a shared resource. The result of this process will be a model course for Introduction to Data Science, including course outline, schedule, learning strategies, assessments, assignments, and resources. This model course is not required for adopting DATA 1501 for your institution but will hopefully provide a foundation for creating a course that supports students’ learning and engaging practice. 

Course development will take place in stages, with reflection (and some homework) in advance of virtual collaborations. The planning process is modeled on Dee Fink’s Significant Learning approach to course design and will use his brief workbook to course design to guide the work. You may be familiar with other approaches to course design, and are welcome to approach this course from the perspective and approach that is best suited to your style and context. 

In adopting this process, we ask that you so some of the development work on your own, and then share, review, and discuss the work with your partners in this process. 
Stage 1 of this process will reflect on the situational factors for the course, review the established learning goals, consider the feedback and assessment procedures we can use to know that students have met the learning objective. 
Stage 2 will identify teaching and learning activities that support the learning goals and provide an opportunity to consolidate the collective course elements to assess their alignment and determine the final consensus components. 
Stage 3 will put the course together – the sequencing of the course into units, the identification and timing of in-class and out-of-class activities for the course, and the day-to-day or week-by-week course calendar. At the end of Stage 3, we hope to emerge with a well-designed course that can be adapted or adopted to a wide range of institutions. 

Sounds like a lot? This process may feel like a big task for a course that isn’t even in the catalog, much less in anyone’s degree map, but we hope it will result in a course that is both highly flexible and extremely well designed. We also hope that creating a community around designing this course we will be able to share some great ideas about instructional design and data science across the system. 

Thanks for joining us on the journey.


 
##Overview for Stage 1
1.  Situational Factors
1.	Review “A Self-Directed Guide to Designing Courses for Significant Learning.” by Dee Fink: https://www.deefinkandassociates.com/GuidetoCourseDesignAug05.pdf 
2.	Reflect on situational factors 
a.	Some are established: lower division course without prerequisites other than exemption from Learning Support; open to students from any program of study
b.	Others are variable: modality; class size; life situation of the learners; background of the instructor

2.  Learning Outcomes
Consider the Learning Outcomes established for the DATA 1501 course (available here). These outcomes were established by the Data Science Working Group and serve as the foundation for the commonly numbered course. Using Fink’s taxonomy of significant learning, assign each learning outcome to the area(s) it is most aligned with. If you find that there are areas not represented, you are invited to craft a learning outcome for that area.

3.  Feedback and Assessment Procedures
A key step in any backwards design approach to course development is the identification of feedback and assessment procedures to check on student learning and mastery and provide them feedback. Because DATA 1501 has a focus on real world data and applications, these procedures naturally lend themselves to authentic assessment of student knowledge and skill through the use of real-life examples and questions. 

Looking at the Learning Outcomes from step 2, and considering the widest range of approaches to how to evaluate student satisfaction of the outcomes, identify at least two forward-looking assessments for the course. You may want to review the USG Office of Faculty Development webinars on Summative and Formative Assessment (halfway down the page) and [this handy toolbox on authentic assessments from Jon Mueller at North Central College]. Keep in mind that not all assessment tasks need to be large or complex to be of value

With these assessment procedures in mind, consider how they measure one of the main learning goals and establish two criteria to demonstrate high quality achievement on that goal and the standards students would distinguish levels of accomplishment.  This is essentially creating a part of an overall rubric for the assessment. For the purposes of this exercise, we will look at four levels of achievement, (essentially: needs work, satisfactory, good, and excellent, although these would vary depending on the criteria being assessed) although you may wish to have fewer or more levels. 

Simultaneously, providing a structured process for students to reflect on their performance helps to develop important skills. These self-assessments can be collective or individual, and may be highly informal, but should point back to the outcomes and expectations for the assessment and invite students to reflect on what they did well, where they could improve, and what they may need to do to achieve mastery.
